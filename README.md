# Audio Materials for CSCI 361
This repository comprises the following branches:
- `main`, the current branch, which includes this `README.md` file as well as a list of additional helpful resources.
- `in_class` and `after_class`, which are both versions of the demo presented in CSCI 361 on 2024-10-16. `after_class` contains the jump and dash sounds we worked on together.
- `dynamic_sfx`, a branch dedicated to a demo on sound effects that change to fit underlying chords. Note that this branch is a work-in-progress and should be treated as such.
